# Security

We take security issues within Labrador very seriously. If you have found a credible attack that originates from Labrador
packages **PLEASE** report the appropriate details to [security@labrador-kennel.io]. The emails sent to this address
adhere to the same rule described in _"Who receives the Report"_ in [Reporting].

If you would like to go a step beyond to ensure prompt resolution of your ticket the following would be extremely 
beneficial:

- Create a private GitHub repository with the vulnerable Labrador package while including a:

    - `EXPLOIT.md` file that describes what the exploit is, how it is carried out, and why it should be considered a 
    vulnerability.
    - `exploit/`  Any source code that could be used to verify the exploit.
